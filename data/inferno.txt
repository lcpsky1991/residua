May God so grant you, reader, to find fruit
In your reading: now ponder for yourself
How I could keep the eyes in my head dry
And with that, putting his own hand in mine,
With smiling face, just to encourage me,
He led me to things hidden from the world.
Silent, solitary, without escort
We walked along, one behind the other
Like minor friars traveling the road.
Day was now fading, and the dusky air
Released the creatures dwelling here on earth
From tiring tasks, while I, the only one,
Readied myself to endure the battle
Both of the journey and the pathos,
Which flawless memory shall here record.
After that I saw a thousand faces so
Purpled by cold that a shivering still
Grips me, and it always will, at frozen ponds
This way we walked together toward the light,
Speaking of things as well unmentioned here
As there it was as well to speak of them.
